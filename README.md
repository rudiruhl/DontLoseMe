# DontLoseMe

**DontLoseMe** is a simple, lightweight World of Warcraft addon that displays a configurable crosshair on your character.

The goal is to help you stay oriented during combat, keeping your eyes focused on the action instead of losing track of your character in visual clutter.

---

## Why use this addon?

### Extremely lightweight
DontLoseMe uses no external libraries and no heavy frameworks.  
It draws a simple UI overlay and does exactly one thing.

### Better visibility in combat
The crosshair stays centered on your character and remains visible even in chaotic encounters with many spell effects and players.

### Flexible conditions
You can choose exactly when the crosshair is shown:
- Always
- In party
- In raid
- Only in combat  

Conditions can be combined, and the addon automatically enables or disables itself based on your selection.

### Simple customization
You can adjust:
- Crosshair shape (Plus or X)
- Size and thickness
- Color and opacity
- X / Y position offset  

All settings are available through the modern Retail Settings UI.

### Clean behavior
If no conditions are selected, the addon automatically disables itself.  
When inactive, configuration controls are greyed out to avoid confusion.

## Configuration

Open the settings via:
- **Esc → Options → AddOns → DontLoseMe**
